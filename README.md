# Analysis on schools in a district
## Overview of the school district analysis
I have the data retrieved from math and reading scores from 15 schools and from four different grades. I want to make an analysis based on this data to see the best performing schools by diferent categories based of the scores of the students. Another problem that came up was that the scores for the 9th graders at Thomas High School may have been altered and it is necessary to ignore this data for our analysis.
## Results
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type
